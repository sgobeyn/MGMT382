<h2 style = "font-size: 16 pt; color:blue; font-family: arial;"><u>What to wear on your hang-gliding adventure!</u></h2>
<center><b2 style=”font-size: 12pt; color: black; font-family: Times New Roman”> Please arrive to your scheduled visit wearing comfortable clothing: a t-shirt, long pants, jacket or windbreaker, closed-toe shoes, & thick socks. DO NOT wear clothes that restrict your movement. Regardless of the daily temperatures, we suggest a few layers of clothing as wind and high altitudes can create an uncomfortably cold experience.</b2></center>
