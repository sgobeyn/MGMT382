<!-- Here is my second h1 header, this time in blue font and regarding the company's history as opposed to story -->
<font color="blue" face="arial"><h1>Company History</h1></font>
<p>
	The company was founded by husband and wife Harry and Harriet Johnson in 1995. Both
	avid and experienced thrill seakers themselves, they decided that they wanted to make
	a living and career off of this passion. That is when they decided to open Harry and
	Harriet's Hang-gliding Haven, and they have been loving it ever since. Their original
	location is just outside the Chicago city limits, where they and their family reside, 
	however they have also added another location just outside Indianapolis. They are 
	looking forward to continuing to expand their operations in the future and continuing 
	to be the leading provider for all things hang-gliding and skydiving related.
